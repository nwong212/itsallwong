Intro: As my final project for my first semester Design class, I designed a board game that was based on the Chinese legends of the Phoenix (feng, 鳳) and the Dragon (long, 龍), and inspired by a pair of vases found in the RISD museum. The ultimate goal of the game is to reach the top and master all of the elements.
