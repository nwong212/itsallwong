Title: Board Game

----

Text: 

Each level is a different element, colored using one of the five primaries of Chinese color theory. Each color also has a corresponding element that follows the same principle: white/metal, red/fire, <em>qin</em>(green/blue)/wood, black/water, and yellow/earth.

The board, instructions, and dice are hand painted in gouache, and the vase player pieces were modeled in AutoCad then printed using a MakerBot 3D printer. The title was printed using a hand carved woodblock.
