Global Initiative (GI) approached me about designing the identity for the —isms exhibit and I couldn't refuse (partly because I volunteered to do it). Collaborating with the RISD MLK Committee, GI invited Emory Douglas to be the honoree for RISD's MLK Series 2017. The logo was designed by both Andi Swedler and I. In the Look and Feel book, I mention a single rule that would define the look of the exhibition: **one thing has to be wrong**. This rule helped to make decisions that emphasized  the human touch and implied a focus on the content rather than the aesthetics (although the resulting aesthetics were also quite rewarding).

**Mark**
The mark acts as a divider, a frame, and an icon. The slash, used in writing as a shorthand for intersections, becomes an elegant gesture symbolic of the multiplicity and diversity of identities represented in the show.
