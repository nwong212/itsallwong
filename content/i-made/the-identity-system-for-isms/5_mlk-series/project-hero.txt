GI partnered with RISD MLK Series this year to sponsor Emory Douglas's visit to the campus. Emory Douglas was the RISD MLK Series Keynote Honoree and participated in a public critique of selected pieces from *—isms*. My participation in the *—isms* exhibit also allowed me to work with RISD MLK Series and the graphic design firm they had hired, sitting in on and contributing to design meetings.

***—isms: Exploring the Intersectionality of Identities*** is open from January 12—February 4 in 4 gallery spaces across the RISD Campus.
