Title: Brand

----

Text: The Titanium Robotics identity pays homage to the team's past through the use of classic brand elements, such as the the firebird insignia, and creates new opportunities for their future through unification and simplification. It appears clean and sophisticated yet retains a witty and youthful personality. The black and white imagery and splashes of color are fun and inviting yet serious and sleek. It captures the essence of the youthful and motivated students who run the team. The students on the team strengthen and refresh the brand by creating a unique interpretation of the identity from year to year that adapts to the constant replacement of graduating students and the different challenges posed at the beginning of each year.
