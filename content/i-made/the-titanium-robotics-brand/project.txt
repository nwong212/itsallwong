I completed a new brand identity for Titanium Robotics with a Brandbook for continuity. After the team renamed themselves to Titanium Robotics, I was asked to refresh the use of the bird logo and implement a new identity using blue and white rather than red and gold.

The rebrand followed a four-year plan for implementation. Over four years, we created a recognition of the new team among the FRC community. We gathered a new sub-team, updated social media accounts, created new graphics, designed a new booth setup, and [created a new website*](//titaniumrobotics.com). The team won the “Imagery Award” at the LA competition, an award that celebrates successful team imagery and identity.

I also gathered a subteam to design a new booth setup that doubles as a "pit" for robot repairs and checkups and a location where judges and other teams can collect information about the team.

<small>*I have since left the team, so any differences in the design of the website from what the screenshots show were directed by the new leadership.</small>
