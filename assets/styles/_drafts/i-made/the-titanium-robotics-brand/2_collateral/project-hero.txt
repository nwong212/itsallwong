In addition to the team's logos, I created booklets, brochures, and posters to be used with the team's branding. This included a Press Kit that included a circular team pin, stickers, and a cascading information kit along with recent press releases. As a way of keeping the brand consistent throughout the years, I also created a Brandbook for the team to reference.
